!Note
I still need to do some more editing, but this should be adequate for now.  -- Steve Brumbaugh, 22 November 2004

!Links
!!WikiNames
*WikiNames are comprised of two or more words put together; each word begins with an uppercase letter, and is followed by at least one lowercase letter or number.
*Words in which this condition is met become a WikiName, and a link is automatically attached.

 HogeRule1    - WikiName
 NOTWIKINAME  - All of the letters are uppercase, so this is not a WikiName
 WikiNAME     - All of the letters in NAME are uppercase, so this is not a WikiName
 *fooWikiName  - This begins with "foo", which is in all lowercase, so this is not a WikiName

*Example output
**WikiName     - WikiName
**HogeRule1    - WikiName
**NOTWIKINAME  - All of the letters are uppercase, so this is not a WikiName
**WikiNAME     - All of the letters in NAME are uppercase, so this is not a WikiName
**fooWikiName  - This begins with "foo", which is in all lowercase, so this is not a WikiName
